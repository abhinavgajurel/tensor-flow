# tensor-flow
Deep learning models for classifying baseball metrics using TensorFlow.js.

- Classifies baseball pitch types:
              Fastball (2-seam), Fastball (4-seam), Fastball (sinker), Fastball (cutter), Slider, Changeup, Curveball


- Predicts the type of pitch from pitch sensor data:
               -> ball velocity (vx0, vy0, vz0)
               -> ball acceleration (ax, ay, az)
               -> starting speed of pitch
               -> whether pitcher is left handed or not
